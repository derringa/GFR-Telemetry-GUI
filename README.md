# GFR Telemetry GUI
A graphic user interface that pulls CAN data from MF4 files, extrapolates that sensor data using associated DBC files, and displays user customizable information. This software is part of an ongoing project by Oregon State University's Global Formula Racing team to educate students thorugh projects related to collecting, storing, managing, and displaying vehicle sensor data. 

# In Developement
The current iteration of this GUI is meant to cooperate with Vector Motors  software that formats and stores data according to ASAM standards for MDF files. In the future GFR hopes to use independent wireless networking hardware and expand thei data collection and display for live telemetry streaming.
